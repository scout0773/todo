# Todo

Learning to build a to-do app using Python and Tkinter. Check `features.TODO` to find out what I will be adding soon.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes included with Python)

# Usage

1. Clone the repository onto your machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
3. Run the `main.py` file using the command `python main.py`.
4. Mess around with the app by creating, editing, and deleting tasks.

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete tasks
- Priority levels (high, medium, low)
- Automatic sorting from top to bottom priority
- Save/load lists (txt)
